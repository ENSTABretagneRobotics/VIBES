{"name":"Vibes","tagline":"Visualizer for Intervals and BoxES","body":"VIBes\r\n=====\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ENSTABretagneRobotics/VIBES.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ENSTABretagneRobotics/VIBES)\r\n\r\n**V**isualizer for **I**ntervals and **B**oxes\r\n\r\nVIBes is a visualization system that aims at providing people working with interval methods a way to display results (boxes, pavings), without worrying with GUI programming. It provides drawing functions accessible from a lot of programming languages, without complex installation and library dependencies.\r\nThe main design goal of VIBes is to be cross-platform, available from different programming languages, simple to set-up, easy to port to a new language.\r\n\r\nVIBes consists in two parts:\r\n- the VIBes application that features viewing, annotating and exporting figures\r\n- the VIBes API that enables your program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures from C, C++, Python, Matlab...\r\n\r\nThe use of a separate viewer application enables an easy set-up on every system. First, pre-built binaries of the VIBes viewer are provided for Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms (but you are free to build the viewer from sources). Then, the API consists only of a few files that have to be included in your program.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
