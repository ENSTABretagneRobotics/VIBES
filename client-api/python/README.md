VIBes is a visualization system that aims at providing people working with interval methods a way to display results (boxes, pavings), without worrying with GUI programming. It provides drawing functions accessible from a lot of programming languages, without complex installation and library dependencies.
The main design goal of VIBes is to be cross-platform, available from different programming languages, simple to set-up, easy to port to a new language.

VIBes consists in two parts:
- the VIBes application that features viewing, annotating and exporting figures
- the VIBes API that enables your program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures from C, C++, Python, Matlab...

This package contains the python API.

To install, run
pip install vibes
