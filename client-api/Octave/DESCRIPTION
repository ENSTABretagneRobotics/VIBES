Title: Interface to VIBes, Visualizer for Intervals and Boxes
Description: The VIBes API allows one to easily display results (boxes, pavings)
 from interval methods.
 
 VIBes consists in two parts: (1) the VIBes application that features viewing,
 annotating and exporting figures, and (2) the VIBes API that enables your
 program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures.
 
 This package integrates the VIBes API into Octave. The VIBes application
 is required for operation and must be installed seperately. Data types from
 third-party interval arithmetic libraries for Octave are also supported.
Depends: octave (>= 4.0.0)
