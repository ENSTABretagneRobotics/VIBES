Title: Interface to VIBes, Visualizer for Intervals and Boxes
Description: VIBes is a visualization system that aims at providing people
 working with interval methods a way to display results (boxes, pavings),
 without worrying with GUI programming. It provides drawing functions
 accessible from a lot of programming languages, without complex installation
 and library dependencies. The main design goal of VIBes is to be
 cross-platform, available from different programming languages, simple to
 set-up, easy to port to a new language.
 
 VIBes consists in two parts: (1) the VIBes application that features viewing,
 annotating and exporting figures, and (2) the VIBes API that enables your
 program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures.
 
 This package integrates the VIBes API into Octave. The VIBes application
 is required for operation and must be installed seperately.
Depends: octave (>= 4.0.0)
